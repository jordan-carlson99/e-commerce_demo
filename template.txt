My project will be a small shopping site with 2 features and a possible 3rd 
1:An add to cart function which will display the item in a cart section of the page based off of a join between 2 tables in the database, when the user selects to do so
2: A customer login modal (that defaults to another profile, guest which will only display cart using js) that uses a base64 auth header that retrieves from a user table. (account creation if i have time left over)
3(optional): a checkout page which would then track hypothetical services or orders in the customer table that can be retrieved in a modal by clicking on the user account

user inputs: 
login -> login modal
add to cart -> displays on side bar
(possible) create account -> create account modal
(possible) checkout -> checkout page

paths: 
get: <body onload=(function to retrieve products from db )>
(after) add to cart: retrieve join of carts and products to display on side
login: retrieve user info to compare 
checkout: get other html

post: add to cart adds row to join table
create account: add user info

patch: remove item from cart
add/remove quantity to cart


tables: 
customer (username[pk] , name, email,password)
// maybe --> cart (id[pk], customer_id [fk], total(?))
cart_product(cart_id[fk](customer_id if omitted), product_id[fk], quantity) 
product(id[pk], price, name, imagelink(?))
